# motivation
This is part of my journey to teach myself python. 
# usage
Play hangman against the computer. The computer pics a word, you try to guess the letter in the word. Pretty simple. Except, the word library has about 2,500 words. Good luck. 

# prompts
You will have six guesses. You can see what letters are still available to guess. Later, if it is too hard
